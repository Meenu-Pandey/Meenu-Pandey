## Hi, I’m Meenu Pandey 👋

Final-year Computer Science student learning software engineering by **building systems and solving problems**, not collecting buzzwords.

## I focus on:

- **Problem-solving** through DSA in Java  
- **Practical software development** with full-stack MERN  
- **Selective AI experiments** to understand real-world applications  

I value **clear logic, clean code, and consistent execution**.

## On GitHub, I build, iterate, and document decisions through code and READMEs.  
If a repository exists, it exists for a reason.

🎯 **Preparing for Software Development Engineer (SDE) roles with a depth-first approach.**
